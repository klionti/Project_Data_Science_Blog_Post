Project: Write a Data Science Blog Post

## Required libraries:
Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## Project motivation:
Based on this global survey, I thought it would be interesting to study which country seems best for software developers from 3 different angles: salary, flexibiity to work remotely, and career satisfaction. I am specifically interested in the answers as a mother of young children who ideally needs all three.

Question 1: Which country pays software developers the most?\
Question 2: Which country is best for software developers to work remotely?\
Question 3: Which country gives software developers the most career satisfaction?

## Files:
Data source files:\
  survey_results_public.csv\
  survey_results_schema.csv\
  hdi.csv

Jupyter Notebooks that explores data to answer the questions posed above:\
  Project_KL1.ipynb    (data understanding + answer to question 1)\
  Project_KL2.ipynb    (answer to question 2)\
  Project_KL3.ipynb    (answer to question 3)\
  Project_KL_country_hdi.ipynb     (annex data used to identify countries with high HDI, used to filter final answers obtained to questions 1, 2 & 3)
